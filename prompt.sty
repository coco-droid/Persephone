The text I want to decompose is: [Can i have Baby ?]Please decompose the text into as many tasks as you think is necessary to get accurate results. I will verify your responses and let you know if they are accurate or not. Please return your responses in an object structure like this: 

{
"task1": {
"name": "title for them ",
"description": "This is the description of task 1",
"subtasks": [
{
"name": "title for them ",
"description": "This is the description of subtask 1",
"command": "Search"
"keywords":"the search query to find information about this"
},
{
"name": "title for them ",
"description": "This is the description of subtask 2",
"command": "Write"
"details":"the details of the task"
},
{
}
]

},
{
"name": "title for them ",
"description": "This is the description of subtask 3",
"command": "Excute"
"cmd":"the command to excute"
}
]
}
}
Add "Read, Write, Search, Think, Excute" in the command field if subtask requires any of these actions the field can have one of them.

I want you to create a list of task that can be performed on the text:[${prompt}] 
Please decompose the text into as many tasks as you think is necessary to get accurate results. 
Please return your responses in an object structure like this:

},{}...]},{"task2...},...
The following properties are found in the subtask object:
name: is a required field for all sub-task value The name of the subtask.
description: is a required field for all sub-task value The description of the subtask.
command: is a required field for all sub-task value Add "Read, Write, Search, Think, Execute" in the command field if subtask requires any of these actions the field can have one of them.
keywords: is a required field for sub-task with Read and Search command  value The keywords that are used to search for information about the subtask.
remember: necessary in some case value A boolean value remembering subtask precedent or other to get information to accomplish this subtask exemple remember:subtask1
linear: is a required field for all sub-task value a boolean true if this substack can introduce new substack like a paradigm change for accomplish a goal and false in other case  
output: is necessary in some case to get a specific information like if the substack need a preference or some information to accomplish
extension:is a required field for all sub-task with Write command value one of them's extesion:'.txt,.py,.js other text and code extesion
